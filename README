Thumbafon has a few elements that could be useful in different projects. It has a synthesis layer that uses additive
synthesis to create anti-aliased waveforms.  It has an Obj-C based Audio Queue class.  It has a C socket and packing
methodology for streaming osc messages. And it has a "slippery button" class that allows sliding from one UIButton 
to another.
